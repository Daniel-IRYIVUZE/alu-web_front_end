# Welcome!

In this project, I have learned how to use HTML tags to structure a web page. No CSS, no styling—the final page is “ugly” and that’s normal; it wasn’t the purpose of this project.

**Important Note:** Paying attention to details was crucial! I made sure to use lowercase where required, avoided typos, and followed best practices.

## Resources
I have read and watched:

- [HTML 5.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)
- [HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
- [HTML Reference - A free guide to all HTML elements and attributes](https://htmlreference.io/)
- [Can I use… Support tables for HTML5, CSS3, etc.](https://caniuse.com/)
- [HTML Cheat Sheet - WebsiteSetup](https://websitesetup.org/html5-cheat-sheet/)
